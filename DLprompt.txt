create DL.py such that:

when it runs it opens a GUI
within the GUI, when no file is selected, display an empty black rectangle that says "NO ID FOUND"
at the top of the GUI, there is a search bar that takes a direct file path input for jsons
If a json follows the following format, display its information within the GUI on the screen

I1234567.json:

{
    DLID: "I1234567"
    FName: "First Name",
    LName: "Last Name",
    DOB: "MM/DD/YYYY",
    Addr: "308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, NM, 87104"
    Sex: "M/F",
    Height: "6'7\"",
    Weight: "200",
    Eyes: "brown",
    Hair: "black",
    Vision: 0-1, (0 = poor; 1 = fair)
    Image: "base 64 encoded image string goes here",
    AssDate: "MM/DD/YYYY",
    ExpDate: "MM/DD/YYYY",
    Strikes: 1-15,
    Donor: 0-1,
    Suspended: 0-1
}

when a DL is open, display a toggle in the top right corner to enable editing
when editing is enabled all text fields can be clicked and edited
when editing is enabled, prompt the user with a file path to a new image when the image is clicked
The image is cropped to be a square no matter its prior resolution
if donor is true display the card on a golden background
if the DLID is changed, change the filename to match it
add the option to create an empty DL and when the button is clicked, create an empty DL and enable editing

when opening a DL, check that:
-the AssDate is at least 16 years after the DOB
-the current date is before the ExpDate
-the strikes are less than 15
-the vision is not poor

if any of these are true suspend the license and display a red "SUSPENDED" stamp on the license

create another script that can view a directory of jsons of the DL datatype
allow it to search for a person using any of the information in stored in the json
